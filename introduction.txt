Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Gaelle Niyonkuru, a youth leader and passionate advocate for education and empowerment. I’m currently studying Mass Communication at East African University Rwanda and actively involved in initiatives that support girls and youth across Africa.

I believe in using knowledge, creativity, and collaboration to drive positive change. Through platforms like GitHub, I’m excited to explore new tools and share resources that uplift communities.
